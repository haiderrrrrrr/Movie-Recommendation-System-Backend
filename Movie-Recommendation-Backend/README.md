# Backend Development for Movie Recommendation System
---

---

## Introduction

---

This project involves developing the **backend** for a **Movie Recommendation System**. The system enables users to browse, rate, and review movies, as well as receive personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and the activity of similar users. Users can also explore extensive movie details, view top movie lists, and check trending movies.

---

## Implementation Requirements

---

The backend is implemented using **ExpressJS** and **MongoDB** to store and manage the movie data. The system incorporates user authentication, profile management, movie database management, and a recommendation engine. The backend implements best practices, with a clear and modular file structure and naming conventions.

### Key Features:

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and JWT authentication.
- **Movie Database**: Admins can add, update, or delete movies.
- **Rating and Review System**: Allows users to rate and review movies.
- **Recommendation System**: Recommends movies based on user preferences and similar user activities.
- **User Profiles and Wishlist**: Users can manage their profiles, preferences, and movie watchlists.
- **Pagination**: All endpoints returning lists implement pagination.

## API Documentation

---

The API endpoints are documented using **Swagger**, and the documentation covers all possible use cases. For each endpoint, both successful responses and error cases are included, with examples of requests and responses.

You can access the API documentation [here](http://localhost:5000/api-docs).
